 ![app icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geeksville/starbash/refs/heads/main/img/icon.png "Starbash: Astrophotography workflows simplified")

A tool for automating/standardizing/sharing astrophotography workflows.

# Current status

Not quite ready ðŸ˜Š.  But making good progress.

See the current [TODO](TODO.md) file for work items.  I'll be looking for pre-alpha testers/feedback soon.

## Current features

* Automatically recognizes and auto-parses the default NINA, Asiair and Seestar raw file repos (adding support for other layouts is easy)
* Multisession support by default (including automatic selection of correct flats, biases and dark frames)
* 'Repos' can contain raw files, generated masters, preprocessed files, or recipes.

## Features coming soon

* Automatically performs **complete** preprocessing on OSC (broadband, narrowband or dual Duo filter), Mono (LRGB, SHO) data.  i.e. give you 'seestar level' auto-preprocessing, so you only need to do the (optional) custom post-processing.
* Generates a per target report/config file which can be customized if the detected defaults or preprocessing are not what you want
* 'Recipes' provide repeatable/human-readable/sharable descriptions of all processing steps
* Repos can be on the local disk or shared via HTTPS/github/etc.  This is particularly useful for recipe repos
* Uses Siril and Graxpert for its pre-processing operations (support for Pixinsight based recipes will probably be coming at some point...)
* The target report can be used to auto generate a human friendly 'postable/sharable' report about that image
* Target reports are sharable so that you can request comments by others and others can rerender with different settings

## Installing

Currently the easiest way to install this command-line based tool is to install is via [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/).  If you don't already have pipx and you have python installed, you can auto install it by running "pip install --user pipx."  If you don't have python installed see the pipx link for pipx installers for any OS.

Once pipx is installed just run:

```
pipx install starbash
  installed package starbash 0.1.3, installed using Python 3.12.3
  These apps are now globally available
    - sb
    - starbash
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨
```

FIXME - add getting started instructions (possibly with a screenshare video)

## Supported commands

### Repository Management
- `sb repo [--verbose]` - List installed repos (use `-v` for details)
- `sb repo add <filepath|URL>` - Add a repository
- `sb repo remove <REPONUM>` - Remove the indicated repo from the repo list
- `sb repo reindex [--force] [REPONUM]` - Reindex the specified repo (or all repos if none specified)

### User Preferences
- `sb user name "Your Name"` - Set name for attribution in generated images
- `sb user email "foo@example.com"` - Set email for attribution in generated images
- `sb user analytics <on|off>` - Turn analytics collection on/off
- `sb user reinit` - Configure starbash via a brief guided process

### Selection & Filtering
- `sb select` - Show information about the current selection
- `sb select list` - List sessions (filtered based on the current selection)
- `sb select any` - Remove all filters (select everything)
- `sb select target <TARGETNAME>` - Limit selection to the named target
- `sb select telescope <TELESCOPENAME>` - Limit selection to the named telescope
- `sb select date <after|before|between> <DATE> [DATE]` - Limit to sessions in the specified date range
- `sb select export SESSIONNUM DESTDIR` - Export the images for indicated session number into the specified directory (or current directory if not specified).  If possible symbolic links are used, if not the files are copied.

## Not yet supported commands

### Export & Processing
