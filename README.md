A tool for automating/standardizing/sharing astrophotography workflows.

# Current status

Not quite ready ðŸ˜Š.  But making good progress.

See the current [TODO](TODO.md) file for work items.  I'll be looking for pre-alpha testers/feedback soon.

## Current features

* Automatically recognizes and auto-parses the default NINA, Asiair and Seestar raw file repos (adding support for other layouts is easy)
* Multisession support by default (including automatic selection of correct flats, biases and dark frames)
* 'Repos' can contain raw files, generated masters, preprocessed files, or recipes.

## Features coming soon

* Automatically performs **complete** preprocessing on OSC (broadband, narrowband or dual Duo filter), Mono (LRGB, SHO) data.  i.e. give you 'seestar level' auto-preprocessing, so you only need to do the (optional) custom post-processing.
* Generates a per target report/config file which can be customized if the detected defaults or preprocessing are not what you want
* 'Recipes' provide repeatable/human-readable/sharable descriptions of all processing steps
* Repos can be on the local disk or shared via HTTPS/github/etc.  This is particularly useful for recipe repos
* Uses Siril and Graxpert for its pre-processing operations (support for Pixinsight based recipies will probably be coming at some point...)
* The target report can be used to auto generate a human friendly 'postable/sharable' report about that image
* Target reports are sharable so that you can request comments by others and others can rerender with different settings
