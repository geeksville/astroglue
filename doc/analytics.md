# Analytics use in Starbash

The volunteer developers on this project use **optional** usage analytics & crash reports to guide our developement.  If you'd like to change this setting, you can run the following:

```
starbash user analytics on|off
```

The service we currently use for this is called [sentry.io](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/).  Because they have good terms for open-source projects.  If you know of a better project to use, please let us know on our [github](https://github.com/geeksville/starbash/issues).
